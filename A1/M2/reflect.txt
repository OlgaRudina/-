1. I think this assignment has asked us to code a struct, Contact, that holds three other structs 
as data members because it makes easier to manage logically related types of data. It looks more compact and allows to store multiple contacts.  

2. The most difficult part of this assignment was the stuctures and pointers part because
there were too many members and it was difficult to track what where to put.  

3. It took around 5 hours to complete Milestone 4 part.
