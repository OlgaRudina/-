WS2:

C-language program that accepts numerical values from the user, stores the values in variables of appropriate data type, 
performs calculations on the stored variables and casts from one data type to another.

WS3: 

Temperature Analyzer: 
- The program prompts the user to enter the high and low values for each of each day. 
The values entered must be between -40 and 40, and high must be greater than low.
- Displays the highest temperature, and on which day it occurred.
- Displays the lowest temperature, and on which day it occurred
- Calculates and displays the mean LOW temperature for the 4-day period
- Calculates and displays the mean HIGH temperature for the 4-day period
- Calculates and displays the mean OVERALL temperature for the 4-day period

WS4:

Temperature Calculator V2.0:
- The program prompts the user to enter the high and low values for each day. 
The values entered must be between -40 and 40, and high must be greater than low.
- Displays the highest temperature for each day.
- Displays the lowest temperature for each day.
- Displays the overall highest temperature, and on which day it occurred
- Displays the overall lowest temperature, and on which day it occurred
- Calculates and displays the average temperature for a specific day (entered by user)

WS5: Employee Data Application 

- Displays Employee information
- Allows to add, update, and remove employee information

A1:
A Contact structure that contains other structures representing the contact Name, Address and phone Numbers

A2: A2 uses A1 and focuses on a “Contact Management System”. This assignment continues to emphasize modularization by compartmentalizing 
highly cohesive and tightly coupled tasks into modules (*.h and *.c files). 
This strategy will reduce redundant coding throughout all parts of the application.
