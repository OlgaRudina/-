1) In one or two sentences explain why the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements?

The arrays is this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements because we have 10 days in sum. The program has to ask user to input 
information about minimum 3 days and maximum 10. 

2) In two or three sentences explain the advantages and disadvantages of using matching arrays?

advantages:

- easy way to store the data of the same type
- easy to manage values

disadvantages: 

- can store data only the same type
- hard to remove the elements or add the new ones and keep the same order

3) Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why?

As for me it was a little bit harder than I expected, because I had to use flags on practice, I knew about them only in theory. 
Also, the loops part in the end of the program was tricky. I tried some combinations to figure out which loop must be inside the other loop.
