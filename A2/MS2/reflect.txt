1. Function is subprogram which can be called by main program anytime. It contains code blocks with local scope variables. 
Function makes program more compact and modular. 
It is easier replace a function (module) than apply all necessary changes to whole program which can contain thousands lines of code. 
Also, when you using functions there is no need to write the same code again and again, you can call a function (1 line of code) wherever you want. 

2. I think the “helper” functions are in different module because it makes possible to copy them in other program and use them there as well.
