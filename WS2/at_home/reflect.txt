1. I think the most important thing I learned in this workshop is how to use casting operation. It was good to know how it works on practice.
2. It is nessessary to add .005 to the value derived when calculating GST owning to round the result to 1.13 and avoid truncation to 1.12 in matrix.
3. The result of casting operation is conversion one type of data to another. In this particular case - conversion from double to int.
4. I think we were required to use the modulus operation in this workshop because it is the easiest way to calculate reminder.
